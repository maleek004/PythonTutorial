# 🧠 Lesson 1 — Setup & Your First Python Code

Welcome to your first Python lesson!  
In this lesson, you'll set up your **coding environment** and write your very first line of Python code — the classic **“Hello, World!”**.

---

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn
- How to set up a Python code editor (online or offline)
- How to install and configure **PyCharm**
- How to create and run your first Python file

---

## 🧩 Step 1: Choose Your Code Editor

Before you can start coding, you need a place to write and run Python code — this is called a **code editor** or **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**.

### 🪄 Option A: Use an Online IDE *(Recommended for Beginners)*
If you want to start quickly **without installing anything**, use an online Python editor:
1. Open your web browser.
2. Search for **“online Python IDE”**.
3. Choose a site such as:
   - [replit.com](https://replit.com)
   - [programiz.com/python/online-compiler](https://www.programiz.com/python/online-compiler)
   - [trinket.io/python3](https://trinket.io/python3)
4. You can start typing Python code immediately — no setup needed!

✅ **This option is more than enough to follow this entire course.**

---

### 💻 Option B: Install PyCharm (Recommended for Long-Term Learning)

If you want a full-featured environment (like professionals use):

1. Visit [jetbrains.com/pycharm/download](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download)
2. Download the **Community Edition** (it’s free).
3. Run the installer and:
   - Keep the default location.
   - ✅ Tick all boxes (e.g., *Add launchers dir to PATH*, *Create associations for .py files*).
4. Once installed, open PyCharm.

## ⚙️ Step 2: Create Your First Python Project

Inside PyCharm:
1. Click **“New Project”**
2. Choose a location (e.g., `Documents/PythonCourse`)
3. Under **Environment**, select **“Virtual Environment (venv)”**
4. Pick a Python version (3.10 or higher is fine)
5. Click **Create**

✨ PyCharm will create your new project with a dedicated Python environment.

## ⚙️ Step 3: Adjust a Few Useful Settings

To make your experience smoother:
1. Go to **File → Settings → Editor → General**
2. Enable ✅ **“Change font size with Ctrl + Mouse Wheel”**
3. This allows you to zoom in/out easily while coding — super handy during lessons!

---

## 🐍 Step 4: Create and Run Your First Script

It’s time to write your first piece of Python code!

1. In the **Project panel (left side)**, right-click on your project folder.  
2. Choose **New → Python File**
3. Name it:  hello_world.py
4. Inside that file, type this line:

```python
print("Hello, world!") 
```

## Step 5: Run the Program

You can run your program in two ways:

Click the Run ▶️ button at the top-right of PyCharm, or

Right-click on the file name and select “Run hello_world”

✅ If everything works correctly, you’ll see:

'Hello, world!'

## 🧩 Mini Challenge (Optional)

Try editing your code to print your name:

```python 
print("Hello, Maleek!")
```

Then try using single quotes (‘) instead of double quotes (“)  both work the same!
